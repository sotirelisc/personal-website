          George was born in Thessaloniki and studied in the department of Electrical Engineer in University of Thessaly, Volos, where he dropped school to work as a freelancer full stack developer for web and mobile applications for various clients. Started studying on startups after attending his first Startup Weekend in Volos in 2014 where he and his team actually failed to win the event, but didn’t give up. Following several proud startup fails he started hopwave.com with his partner and cofounder George Siatras, and has successfully won several startup competitions, raising his first funds for his venture. Being an active jack of all trades in the tourism industry and with knowledge on tech, startups, team and project management he’d be glad to help you with anything you need.
