          Nick was born and raised in Kavala, a city with scenery that stimulates an artistic perception of the world. The colours, the shapes and the feelings accomplished their purpose and so he became a dedicated graphic designer. But, besides the poetic side of life, Nick Savopoulos is now a branding specialist, with over 10 years of experience. He is the Founder and Creative Director of _Artware_, a branding Agency located in Kavala, and Co-Founder of _Skye_, a branding agency specialising in Hospitality Companies and how they can communicate their values.
Nick believes that a Success Story is not just a simple story; it is only a fragment of a greater Philosophy.
