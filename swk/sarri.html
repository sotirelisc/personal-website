          Christie graduated as a civil Engineer from the University of Rome - La Sapienza and gained experience in designing and building structures working with the international companies on projects with high social impact. Involved since the very beginning in the business development of those companies she nourished further her interest in strategic modelling of businesses. Her MBA (Warwick University) and Open Innovation courses (Berkley) facilitated the co-generation of the VES - Value Exchange System tool (Meggitt Bird) and a series of publications explaining the benefits of the hybrid business model. Mapping problems and evaluating businesses prior to leading them to an innovative growth strategy are her main impact areas. Through pom - a coworking space in Heraklion she envisages bridging Cretans with a global community of like-minded people. She also runs her own engineering consultancy Christie Sarri & Partners.
