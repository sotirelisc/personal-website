          Valentine started his very own mobile app startup and developed it all by himself, at the age of 18. Magazines such as Forbes say that he has the 'mark of a true entrepreneur'! Proud awardee of the 25Under25 title of the Internet Society organization. After attending SXSW and the successful acquisition of his startup, Valentine is touring, spreading knowledge and motivation among the youth of Greece and the UK! As he says, it's a mission, not a job. At the age of 20, Valentine is trying to reduce the world's mass misinformation spread issue by creating the world's first AI-powered News Analysis algorithm.
