          Therapon was born and raised in Thessaloniki. Studied Electrical Engineer at Democtitus University of Thrace and for many years was active in public and private construction works.
As a strong believer of the motto that every challenge hides a new chance, he used the crisis in the construction field as a trigger for a personal development.
Having attended various specialized seminars and completed with success the program “Certificated in Coaching of the Athens Coaching Institute”, he is now working on “alternative” energy sources, those that encourage and move people and companies to accomplish their goals.His favorite quote is: ¨After all, No barrier is greater from a person’s or a company’s will.
